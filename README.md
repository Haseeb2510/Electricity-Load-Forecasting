# ⚡ Electricity Load Forecasting

This project focuses on forecasting **hourly electricity demand** using multiple model families and comparing how they perform under **stable conditions** and during **regime shifts** (e.g., the COVID-19 period).  
The goal is to understand **which model is best suited for different real-world forecasting contexts**.

## 🎯 Objective

The project evaluates three time-series modeling approaches:

| Model Type | Model Used | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Tree-Based | **XGBoost** | Strong baseline for stable seasonal behavior |
| Sequence Model | **LSTM** | Learns week-long temporal patterns directly from sequences |
| Attention-Based Model | **Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)** | Handles multivariate relationships and adapts to regime shifts |

We compare how these models handle:

- Weekly and daily **seasonality**
- **Long-range temporal dependencies**
- **Structural changes** in demand behavior (e.g., COVID impact)

The goal is **not** to find a single “best” model, but to identify **which model is most appropriate for which operational scenario**.

## 🧹 Data Preparation & Feature Engineering

![Model Comparison](reports/EDA/Electricity_Demand_Analysis.png)


Key preprocessing steps:

- Handled missing timestamps and small gaps (forward-fill)
- Extracted time features: `hour`, `dayofweek`, `is_weekend`, `year`
- Created lag features to model short-, medium-, and long-term memory
- Compressed correlated weather variables into **3 PCA components**
- Scaled numeric features using **StandardScaler (fit on train only)** to avoid data leakage
- **COVID Impact Analysis**: Using a binary flag `covid_period`, I compared average pre-COVID vs post-COVID demand.


The final dataset includes **both contextual and temporal features**, suitable for tree-based, recurrent, and transformer models.

## 🤖 Models

### 1) XGBoost (Tree-Based)
- Learns from engineered lag and cyclical features
- Excellent baseline for stable demand with recurring seasonality

### 2) LSTM (Sequential Neural Network)
- 2 LSTM layers: **128 → 64 units**
- Dropout + L2 regularization
- Trained on **168-hour sliding windows** (one full week of context)

### 3) Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)
- Uses:
  - **Attention mechanisms**
  - **Gating**
  - **Variable selection layers**
- Initially struggled during COVID regime shift → **Fine-tuned** on recent data to adapt successfully

## 📊 Model Performance (Summary)

| Model | MAE ↓ | RMSE ↓ | MAPE ↓ | Interpretation |
|------|------|------|-------|----------------|
| **XGBoost** | Low | Low | Lowest | Best during stable seasonal behavior |
| **LSTM** | Medium | Higher | ~10% | Captures weekly structure, less precise overall |
| **TFT (initial)** | High | High | Struggled | Unable to generalize across COVID demand shift |
| **TFT (fine-tuned)** | Improved Significantly | Much Lower | ~5% | Successfully adapts to structural change |
